nh.new-feature.title = NEW UPDATE!

nh.new-feature.balance = [lightgray]BALANCE[]:
nh.new-feature.feature = [lightgray]FEATURE[]:
nh.new-feature.content = [lightgray]CONTENT[]:
nh.new-feature.important = [royal]Important Update[]:
nh.new-feature.description = [accent]Description: []
nh.new-feature.important-0 = [sky] NEW HORIZON [2.0-beta-1][V8-150+] UPDATE []
nh.new-feature.important-0-desc = Major update. The progression, factories, and more have been significantly reworked. \nThe main campaign isn't complete yet, but the content is compatible with the progression of Serpulo/Erekir gameplay. \nAfter approximately 60+ minor version iterations and server testing, this version should be playable. \nThere may be minor bugs that don't affect gameplay, i will fix those later. \nIf you have any questions, please report them in the NH Discord or start an issue on GitHub. \n\nHave fun!
nh.new-feature.feature-0 = Unique non-rect factory content
nh.new-feature.feature-0-desc = After several iterations from the prototype, the non-rect factories should be playable.\nThey should act the same with normal factory in logic as expected.\nDue to game limitations, the center of non-rect factory remains to act as a normal rect block.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay should be very unique when design schematics.
nh.new-feature.feature-1 = Event/Cutscene Rework Based on the World Processor
nh.new-feature.feature-1-desc = The update has significantly reworked events and cutscenes, making them compatible with the World Processor. This new version has significantly split the original control logic and rewritten it into a large number of single instructions.\nI will still improve and maintain it in the future.
nh.new-feature.feature-2 = Vanilla Override and Settings Improvement
nh.new-feature.feature-2-desc = The old version's vanilla overrides were unclear and non-customizable. This new version has significantly reworked the mod setting's dialog. \nMany options are now grouped and can be freely enabled. Vanilla overrides now consist of a number of sub-options, which you can customize to your needs. \nJoining a server still requires enabling all vanilla override sub-options. Multiplayer games hosted on your own device still require all vanilla overrides to be enabled. This is unintended and will be adjusted and fixed in the future.
nh.new-feature.feature-3 = Alternative Payload Gameplay: Modules
nh.new-feature.feature-3-desc = This version adds several new payload-related content: modules. Modules can be thought of as simple 1x1 payload, but they offer greater flexibility than vanilla. \nModule content is relatively optional and not required for advanced technology. \nModules can be sent into jump gates as raw materials for manufacturing units or for high-efficiency recipes. \nFurther expansion of module logs and module gameplay will be planned.
nh.new-feature.feature-4 = New Mechanic: Damage Type
nh.new-feature.feature-4-desc = The new version introduces a new, yet-to-be-implemented mechanic: the Damage Type. \nCurrently, this mechanic is only implemented on turrets. \nThe new mechanic differentiates between kinetic and energy damage, aiming to facilitate more strategic tower defense layouts. \nUnits with shields (both shield ability and wave shields) will only absorb energy damage. \nIf their shield capacity is depleted, they will only absorb kinetic damage. This mechanic encourages the combined use of turrets, preventing the situation where a single turret is overpowered. \nHowever, as this mechanic is still under development, please be patient and wait for its future development.
nh.new-feature.content-0 = Multi-Recipe Factory
nh.new-feature.content-0-desc = New Horizons introduces a large number of factories that use multiple recipes. \nUnlike standard factories that select their own recipe, these factories can select the appropriate recipe based on the input items. \nThis type of factory is intended to reduce the number of unnecessary advanced or replacement factories.
nh.new-feature.content-1 = Jump Gate Changes
nh.new-feature.content-1-desc = Jump Gate has get significant optimizations and improvements, and the UI has been simplified and improved.
nh.new-feature.content-2 = Logistics Changes
nh.new-feature.content-2-desc = The new version adds a large number of logistics blocks. \nMost of these are more powerful than vanilla. The visuals have also been unified. \nMore logistics content will be added later.
nh.new-feature.content-3 = Gravity Well Changes
nh.new-feature.content-3-desc = Gravity Wells are now integrated with Power Nodes. Additionally, in non-sandbox mode, HLR require in the Gravity Well range to be constructed.
